# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project contains code that when ran will create a tic tac toe game for 2 people!

Included is the Main File as well as two header files that determine variables for Game and Player  classes.

Once run the game is played on a 3 x 3 grid and players take turns calling which grid spot they would like to play on until a winner is determined or a tie is reached!
